# pepper_meshes2

This package allows you to install the Aldebaran Pepper meshes for ROS2

When building a binary package, please make sure that with the installer the user has to agree to
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License
that is given in the LICENSE file: this is the only requirement from Aldebaran.

Justification: in French law, only clicking/entering text is recognized as a virtual signature;
the LICENSE file is therefore not sufficient. Aldebaran allows you to redistribute those
meshes as long as they are given through an installer that asks the user to click/enter "ok/yes".


Also, the history of that repo will be frequently re-written ! we don't want to keep the old history
of the meshes as this could result in heavy cloning.
